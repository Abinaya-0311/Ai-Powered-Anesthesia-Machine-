# AI Assisted Anesthesia Machine

## ABSTRACT
The AI Assisted Anesthesia Machine project focuses on predicting postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgery using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes patient data such as demographic details, type of surgery, anesthesia used, and duration of surgery to predict the likelihood of complications after surgery.

Machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost are used to classify the surgical outcome into two categories:  
0 – No complications  
1 – Complications present  

The system helps healthcare providers identify high-risk patients in advance, enabling better anesthesia management and improved patient safety.

## INTRODUCTION
Anesthesia management plays an important role in surgical success and patient recovery. Despite medical advancements, postoperative complications like nausea, bleeding, and delayed recovery still occur. Traditional systems depend on manual observation and doctor experience, which may lead to delayed intervention.

This project uses machine learning to predict postoperative complications based on patient-specific data, supporting personalized anesthesia care.

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Existing anesthesia management systems lack personalized prediction of postoperative complications. The absence of automated prediction models results in reactive treatment rather than proactive care. Hence, a predictive system is required to assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential complications before they occur.

---

## OBJECTIVES
- To collect and preprocess patient surgery data
- To implement machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- To predict postoperative complications accurately
- To evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- To develop a user-friendly web application for prediction

---

## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The project predicts postoperative complications based on historical patient data. The output is a binary classification indicating the presence or absence of complications. The system does not include real-time anesthesia monitoring or dosage control.
